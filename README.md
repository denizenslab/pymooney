pymooney
========

This repository helds the python scripts to generate twotone, Mooney images. The main code is crmooney.py.

You can

(i) use search words that will be used to search images with these search words in online image databases and the Mooney images will be generated based on these images. (API key and secret are required).

(ii) you can give a directory with images

(iii) you can give one image path

The easiest way to use these scripts is to check the main-function in crmooney.py and write a wrapper funciton based on that.


Requirements
========

* flickrapi [Beej's Python Flickr API](http://stuvel.eu/media/flickrapi-docs/documentation/)

(You need a Flickr API key and secret if you want to make use of the image search. Check [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api) for more information.)

* Flickr API key and secret in the .env file

* dependencies installed from the requirements.txt
